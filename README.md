Erasures are poems in which some words have been erased or blacked out, creating gaps in the text. "Erasure" (this website) is a tool for creating erasures using the PoetryDB poetry database.

Write a word or phrase in the search bar (or leave it blank), click "Find a poem," and the app will return a random poem that contains the search terms.

Then use the slider to erase more or less of the poem.

Click the Whiteout/Blackout button to switch from whited out to blacked out text
