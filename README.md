Erasures are poems in which some words from a preexisting text (poetry, prose, a legal document...) have been erased or blacked out, creating gaps in the text. "Erasure" (this website) is a tool for creating erasures using the PoetryDB poetry database, which contains many public domain poems by authors like William Shakespeare, Emily Dickinson, Robert Burns, etc.

To use the site, select the search type you want to perform: author, title, or keyword. Enter your search term and click "find." The search will return ten randomly selected poems, unless there are less than ten poems that match the search criteria, in which case it will return as many poems as it can find.

Click "Erase!" to see an erasure in which 50% of each poem's words are randomly blacked out. Click "Reveal!" to undo the erasure. Each time you click "Erase!", a different set of words will be blacked out

If you hover over a poem, the dotted border will turn solid.

If you click on a poem, it will be surrounded by a blue border. Click again and the border will go away. This is a way to mark poems to return to later.

Some code for the dropdown menu was taken from w3schools.com
