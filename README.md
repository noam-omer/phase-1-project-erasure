Erasures are poems in which some words have been erased or blacked out, creating gaps in the text. "Eras_re" (this website) is a tool for creating erasures using the PoetryDB poetry database.

To use the site, select the search type you want to perform: author, title, or keyword. Enter your search term and click "find." The search will return ten poems, unless there aren't ten poems that match the search terms.

At this time the keyword search can't handle multiple words.

Click "Erase!" to see an erasure in which 50% of each poem's words are randomly blacked out. Click "Reveal!" to undo the erasure.
